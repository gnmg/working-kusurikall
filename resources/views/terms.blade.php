        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <br>
        <ol>

            <li><b>User (“You”, “Your”)</b><br>
                A user of the service refers to any person of legal age, or minor who received the consent of their
                legal representative, which has registered on www.memo24.net and is using the Service.
            </li>

            <li><b>Recipient</b><br>
                A recipient of the service is any natural person who receives a voice reminder/notification or an SOS
                alert (via email or short message service, i.e. SMS).
            </li>

            <li><b>Voice reminder and notification</b><br>
                A voice reminder or notification, also called sms voice, is a telephone call that is placed and followed
                by a played sound message to a recipient. In the remainder of the document the word reminder and
                notification will be used interchangeably. Sending a reminder is meant as the action of placing a
                telephone call and playing a sound message.
            </li>

            <li><b>SOS alert</b><br>
                In the event that the callee does not pick up or the call fails to reach the callee, the user can chose
                to send an SOS alert as an SMS or an email.
            </li>

            <li><b>Service</b><br>
                Memo24 (“Memo24.net”, “We,” “Us,” “Our”) provides an online application to set up and send voice
                reminders and notifications. It allows the Users to enter the details of the voice reminder along with
                the recipient(s) details and to subsequently send this reminder based on a (repetitive) schedule. The
                service also sends predefined SMSes (short message service) and emails when the User choses to send SOS
                alerts.
                NOTE THAT THE SERVICE SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A REPLACEMENT FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL CARE SERVICES.
            </li>

            <li><b>Registration and Acceptance of Terms and Conditions</b><br>
                By registering with www.memo24.net, the User agrees to these Terms and Conditions and to the <a
                    href="privacy.php">Privacy Policy</a>. Registration shall mean entering an email address, a
                password, and an optional full name with which usage and access to the Service can be granted.
                Memo24.net reserves the right to change these Terms and Conditions and/or Privacy Policy. If Memo24.net
                decides to make such (a) change(s), it will be amended to this document or to the Privacy Policy
                document and posted on the website www.memo24.net.
            </li>

            <li><b>Pricing and Payment terms</b><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pricing and pricing modalities for sending voice and SOS alerts can be found on www.memo24.net.
                    </li>
                    <li>Memo24.net reserves the right to issue price changes in the event of (but not necessarily only)
                        telecom operators’ price changes. Price changes will be advertised on www.memo24.net.</li>
                    <li>Memo24 reserves the right to change the list of countries and list of languages for which the
                        User can set up a voice reminder.</li>
                    <!--li>Credits bought are non-refundable; i.e. once the User makes a payment to credit his/her account, then the User cannot claim back the money for unused credits. However, at our (and only our) discretion, Memo24 might (but is not obliged to) issue a refund for amounts exceeding 20 USD or refund in case of a substantial price increase (a very rare event and often due to Telecom operators’ policies) that is no longer considered acceptable by the User.</li-->
                    <li>Credits bought are non-refundable; i.e. once the User makes a payment to credit his/her account,
                        then the User cannot claim back the money for unused credits.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Suspension of service and cancellation</b><br>
                Memo24.net may unilaterally terminate a User’s account without notice, by notifying the User by any
                means and without further formality, particularly in the following cases:
                <ul>
                    <li>Attempted act of piracy to the website www.memo24.net or the Service, or the data they contain.
                    </li>
                    <li>Impersonating a third party.</li>
                    <li>Violation of one or more terms of the current document.</li>
                </ul>
                This clause eliminates the need for Memo24 to be held responsible, in front of a legal court, for any
                account termination.
            </li>

            <li><b>User’s responsibility</b><br>

                suspension.
